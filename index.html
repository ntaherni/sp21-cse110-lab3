                    <p class="block">The day is Sunday, April 4th. Today is Easter. I woke up around 9 in the
                        morning and proceeded to do some <em>homework for one of my classes</em>, I forget
                        exactly which class, but I remember <strong>doing the work</strong>. I also read a book,
                        <i>The Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage</i> by <b>Haruki Murakami</b>,
                        one of my favorite authors.<br>

                        <p class="inline">
                        If you have any interest in getting the book you can find it <a

                        Overall I would say my classload this quarter is manageable. The classes I am taking are:

                    After doing the homework I remember having lunch then watching sports in the afternoon.
                    After watching sports I remembered it was around dinner time, so I went back to my room
                    to get dressed for our Easter dinner. My family decided not to do Easter brunch which is
                    the typical thing to do and instead just have an Easter dinner which was nice. After that
                    I went to read more, and called my girlfriend at night before going to bed.

                    <p class="block">The day is Monday, April 5th. Today I had to drive back to San Diego from Palm Desert, so as
                        soon as I woke up around 9 or 10 A.M. I packed up and left. On the way home, I listened to a
                        song my girlfriend showed me a few days ago multiple times. The song is in a mix of Mandarin
                        and English, here is the song:
                        <br>
                        <audio controls>
                            <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                            Your browser does not support the audio tag.
                        </audio>
                        <br>
                        I got to San Diego around 12:30 or 1 P.M. so I still had time to spare before my class at 2 P.M.
                        I set up the CloudLabs software for CSE 140L, which I plan to use for my lab later this week.
                        Then I had two classes, CSE 140L and MATH 170B, which kept me busy during the afternoon. After I
                        attended class I worked out for a bit, then I had dinner and continued reading like the previous
                        night. After I read I called my girlfriend, where she showed me the music video and explained
                        the
                        lyrics of the song by directly translating them. The music video is here:
                        <br>
                        <video width="320" height="240" controls>
                            <source src="musicvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        </video>
                        <br>
                        After this I went to bed.

                    <p class="block">On Tuesday, April 7th, I woke up and read more before my class, CSE 140, at 12:30 P.M. I also set
                        up
                        my group Slack and introductions, etc. since I was chosen as a leader for group 5. Then I went
                        to class, taking notes as it went on. After class, I planned to get a haircut so I went and got
                        a
                        haircut nearby. On the way home from the haircut my car was low on gas so I got some more, and I
                        also got boba on the way home too. When I got home it was around 3:45 P.M., right before CSE 110
                        began, so I sat down and watched the lecture as it went on. After the lecture I went to play
                        tennis
                        nearby until 6:30, at which point I got dinner and ate. After eating I kept reading the book,
                        eventually finishing it. After I finished it I called my girlfriend again and we talked for a
                        while
                        about the book, since she had read it in the past and recommended it to me. After that I went to
                        sleep.
